# Mars Explorer Example

explorer.rb is the main file. It takes the instruction file as an input. I've committed earth_instructions.txt as an example file.

Example command:
ruby explorer.rb "earth_instructions.txt"

__This is a work in progress project, there are no tests and the code needs to be cleaned up__
